# belly-button-challenge
In this challenge, built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
The app can be found in the github page through the link https://jean-liang.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

app.js file read data in the samples.json displays two graphs:
- Bar graph for "Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found", top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Bubble chart for "Bacteria Cultures Per Sample", reflect the relationship between the OTU ID and Number of Bacteria.
In the final "Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard", when the Test Subject ID No. selected, it will bring up the corresponding "Demographic Info", bar graph and bubble chart.
See below dashboard display for Test subject ID 940:
